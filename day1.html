        <h2 class="devo-title">No Matter the Cost</h2>
        <p class="devo-verse"> Fight the good fight of faith.
          <br>-1 Timothy 6:12</p>
        <p class="devo-content"><strong>LIFE IS SHORT, AND EACH OF US MUST DECIDE HOW WE</strong> will spend our time. The apostle Paul said, “So then, be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is” (Ephesians 5:15-17).</p>
        <p class="devo-content">The devil is relentless in his efforts to undermine God’s work and advance evil. God’s will is for us to take a stand, to push back against the darkness. Paul said, “be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong” (1 Corinthians 16:13). That bravery and strength can take many different forms.</p>
        <p class="devo-content"> It is crucial that we fight through the Spirit, not the flesh. Fighting through the flesh gives power to the Enemy. Even when we fight in the name of God, if we fight through the flesh, we will do more harm than good. Only the Spirit can help us fight the right battles effectively.</p>
        <p class="devo-content">Most of the apostles and early Christian leaders were put to death because of their faith. Paul was beheaded. Peter was crucified. John escaped being killed but was held as a prisoner on the island of Patmos. We may never face martyrdom, torture, or imprisonment for our faith as the early Christians did, but our commitment to Christ should be no less radical than theirs. Jesus made it clear that there is no place in God’s kingdom for lukewarm Christians. We cannot live for God and for the sinful world.</p>
        <p class="devo-content">Jesus said, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; but who loses his life for My sake will find it” (Matthew 16:24-25). If we truly follow Jesus Christ, we need to destroy our own selfish, sinful desires. We need to give our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole mind to Jesus.</p>
        <p class="devo-content">That’s easier said than done in this immoral, materialistic world we live in, because our sinful nature wants to live in sin. That’s why Jesus encouraged His followers to think in terms of investment: “For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Matthew 16:26). Success, popularity, comfort, and safety in this world may seem like valuable things to strive for, but they’re all fleeting and ultimately worthless when our lives are over. Their value pales in comparison to the value of where our souls will be for all eternity.</p>
        <p class="devo-content">This takes us back to where we started. This world is temporary, a drop in the ocean compared to the eternal life God has in store for us. If we invest ourselves in standing up for God’s truth, no matter the cost, we will enjoy the rewards forever. </p>
